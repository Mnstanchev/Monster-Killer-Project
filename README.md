# Monster-Killer-Project

This is a Monster Killer Project, where we have the health of the monster and the player with bonus life ( in case of player's health drops to 0 ) to recover, but only for 1 time.
We have 4 buttons witch we can press to attack the monster, to launch a strong attack, to heal ourselfs and to output logs.
